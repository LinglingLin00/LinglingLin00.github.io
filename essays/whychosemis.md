Throughout the past years, I have seen many of my friends majoring or minoring in MIS. Every time we have conversations about the classes, they made it sound very interesting and actually tried to convince me to take MIS related classes. Looking back, I remembered I did have fun in ICS 101, so I thought why not try out something new. Even though ITM352 might be a hard class for me, I would like to challenge myself to learn more about MIS. And hopefully at the end of the course I will have a deeper understanding of MIS.
